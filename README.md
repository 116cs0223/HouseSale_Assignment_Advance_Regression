#  Name
> Boombikes , a US based bike-sharing company has suffered considerable loss in revenues due to Corona pandemic. To understand what data is affecting the demand for bike in the locality/country. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are mostly affecting the demand for the shared bike.
2. How good are those variables in predicting the demand
The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and come up with a linear regreassion model to predict demand on basis of some independent variables.

## General Information
- Here we have to create a linear regression model for the probelem statement.
- Boombikes , a US based bike-sharing company has suffered considerable loss in revenues due to Corona pandemic. To understand what data is affecting the demand for bike in the locality/country. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are mostly affecting the demand for the shared bike.
2. How good are those variables in predicting the demand
The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and come up with a linear regreassion model to predict demand on basis of some independent variables.

- The privide dataset has diofferent fields like season, year,month, day of week,weather condition(temperrature,humidity,windspeed), type of day(weekday or weekend) and  target variable i.e. count of bike sales on a particular day.

## Conclusions

- year, weathersit, season and humudity  are the imporatnt features that significantly impact the demand of shared bikes.
