#  Name
>A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

 

The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.
3. Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## General Information
- Here we have to create a linear regression model for the probelem statement.
- Boombikes , a US based bike-sharing company has suffered considerable loss in revenues due to Corona pandemic. To understand what data is affecting the demand for bike in the locality/country. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are mostly affecting the demand for the shared bike.
2. How good are those variables in predicting the demand
The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and come up with a linear regreassion model to predict demand on basis of some independent variables.

- The privide dataset has diofferent fields like season, year,month, day of week,weather condition(temperrature,humidity,windspeed), type of day(weekday or weekend) and  target variable i.e. count of bike sales on a particular day.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions

- year, weathersit, season and humudity  are the imporatnt features that significantly impact the demand of shared bikes.
